Python Objects
- Objects are a way for programmers to define their own Python
  types and create abstractions of things with the programming language.
- Each object may have a certain state that gets modified throughout
  program execution
- Object Oriented (OO) programming is a way programs use and manipulate objects
  to solve problems and model real-world properties
- Object Oriented programming is NOT REQUIRED
    - It's more of a way to organize, read, maintain, test, and debut software
      in a manageable way

Ex. We've been using objects already...
>>> x = [1,2,3]
>>> type(x)
<class 'list'>
>>> x.count(3)
1
>>> x.count(-1)
0
>>> x.append(0)
>>> x
[1, 2, 3, 0]

- count, append, etc are all examples of methods that can be called on an object.
- Methods are like functions but are associated with an object
- In this case, Python already defined its own class called list that we can use,
  but sometimes we want to create our own specific objects for the applications
  weâ€™re trying to build!

- Methods can be called on objects that have a state (values)
